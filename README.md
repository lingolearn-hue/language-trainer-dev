# Language Trainer

Version: 0.5 — 2026-08-11

React-based long-form language tutor simulation. Static content, multiple
trainer personas, block-based session engine with pause/resume.

See `/spec` (in project history) for concept, trainer, and lesson-structure docs.

## Dev

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Test

```
npx playwright install chromium   # first time only
npx playwright test
```

## Playwright in constrained sandboxes

If `npx playwright install` can't reach `cdn.playwright.dev` (blocked egress),
use the Chromium binary bundled in `@sparticuz/chromium` (distributed via npm)
instead:

```
npm install -D @sparticuz/chromium
node -e "require('@sparticuz/chromium').default.executablePath().then(console.log)"  # or .mjs, see note below
PW_CHROMIUM_PATH=/tmp/chromium npx playwright test
```
Note: `@sparticuz/chromium`'s CJS export is unreliable via `require()` in some
Node versions — resolve the path via a `.mjs` script if `require` gives you
`{ graphicsMode }` only.
